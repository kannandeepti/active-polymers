Simulations of Active Rouse polymers (based on wlcsim.bd.rouse)
---------------------------------------------------------------

We adapt the `wlcsim.bd.rouse <https://github.com/SpakowitzLab/wlcsim>`_ module developed by the
Spakowitz Lab to perform Brownian dynamics simulations of Rouse polymers driven by correlated,
active noise. Simulations are accelerated using just in
time compilation (jit) using the package Numba.

Contains routines for easily parameterizing Rouse polymer simulations and some
simple pre-built example simulators:
    1. **with_srk1**: Example Rouse simulator with 1st order SRK integrator. Uses a discrete Rouse
       chain to approximate a semiflexible chain with parameters ``(N, L, b,
       D)``", where :math:`N` is the number of beads, :math:`L` is the physical
       length of the chain (see note below), :math:`b` is the Kuhn length, and
       :math:`D` is an array specifying the diffusion coefficients of the N monomers.
       If the same value is specified for all N beads, then we recover equilibrium
       Rouse polymer dynamics.
    2. **recommended_dt**: Given ``(N, L, b, D)``, compute the recommended
       maximum step size for an equilibirum Rouse polymer simulation.
    3. **measured_D_to_rouse**: compute the diffusivity-per-Kuhn length
       (:math:`D`, required as input for simulations) from a log-log linear
       regression fit to an MSD with slope 1/2 (the usual way to measure
       diffusivity of a polymer bead).

Variations on the basic simulator in `with_srk1` are also available, including
a version of the code with a second order stochastic runge kutta integrator.

.. note::
    While a Rouse chain does not technically have a well-defined length in the
    traditional sense of arc-length (due to its fractal nature), since our
    ultimate goal is the modeling of semiflexible polymers like DNA, we
    typically think of Rouse polymers as long length scale approximations of an
    underlying semiflexible chain with persistence length :math:`l_p = b / 2`.
    For an explicit derivation that all semiflexible chains can be
    well-approximated by the Rouse model on long enough length scales, see the
    third chapter of Doi & Edwards."

Notes
-----
There are various ways to parameterize Rouse polymers. In this module, we use
the convention that :math:`N` (``N`` in the code) is the number of beads of a
Rouse polymer (contrary to e.g. Doi & Edwards, where ``N`` is the number of
Kuhn lengths in the polymer). We instead use :math:`\hat{N}` (``Nhat`` in the
code) for the number of Kuhn lengths in the polymer.
.. warning:
    This is different from the convention in :mod:`wlcsim.analytical.rouse`,
    where :math:`N` is the number of Kuhn lengths in the polymer, to match the
    usual conventions in e.g. Doi & Edwards.
:math:`D` is the "diffusivity of a Kuhn length", i.e. :math:`k_bT/\xi`, where
:math:`\xi` is the dynamic viscosity of the medium in question, as typically
found in the Langevin equation for a continuous Rouse polymer:
    .. math::
        \xi \frac{d}{dt} \vec{r}(n, t)
        = k \frac{d^2}{dn^2} \vec{r}(n, t) + f^{(B)}
where :math:`k = 3k_BT/b^2` is the "spring constant" for a Rouse polymer with
Kuhn length :math:`b`, and :math:`n` is the continuous coordinate specifying
our location along the chain.
In order to recreate the diffusion of this continuous chain with our discrete
chain of beads, it can be shown that we must choose the diffusion coefficient
of each bead should be set to :math:`\hat{D} = D (N/\hat{N})` (``Dhat`` in the
code). Since :math:`\xi` is in units of "viscosity per Kuhn length" and
:math:`(N/\hat{N})` is in units of "number of beads over number of Kuhn
lengths", this can be thought of as changing units from "viscosity per Kuhn
length" to "viscosity per bead".
Some books use :math:`b` for the mean (squared) bond length between beads in
the discrete gaussian chain. We instead use :math:`b` to be the real Kuhn
length of the polymer, so that the mean squared bond length :math:`\hat{b}^2`
is instead given by ``L0*b``, where ``L0 = L/(N-1)`` is the amount of polymer
"length" represented by the space between two beads.
The units chosen here make the most sense if you don't actually consider the
polymer to be a "real" Rouse polymer, but instead an e.g. semiflexible chain
with a real "length" whose long distance statistics are being captured by the
simulation.
.. figure:: rouse-regimes.svg
    The analytical result for the MSD of a discrete, (free-draining) Rouse
    polymer diffusing with no confinement. Because a discrete polymer is
    composed of finitely many beads, there exists a minimum time scale below
    which the system will appear to behave as though each bead was diffusing
    independently (:math:`\approx t^1`). At slightly longer time scales, the
    beads will begin to feel the effects of the springs connecting them
    together. Namely, as each bead attempts to diffuse in a given direction, it
    will always feel a restoring force from the rest of the polymer "dragging"
    it back, slowing the MSD to scale instead like :math:`t^{1/2}`. Finally at
    time scales longer than the "Rouse time" of the polymer, the entire polymer
    can be thought of as one large "effective" bead with a diffusivity
    :math:`N` times smaller than the individual beads, and will again exhibit
    regular diffusion (:math:`t^1` scaling).
    It is worthwhile to note that the case of the continuous Rouse polymer,
    there is no shortest time scale (because of its fractal nature, wherein at
    each time point, the Rouse chain's spatial configuration traces out a
    Brownian walk). In this case, the :math:`t^{1/2}` behavior simply stretches
    out to arbitrarily short time scales.
    For a more detailed discussion of the scaling behavior of Rouse MSD's, see
    the `measured_D_to_rouse` function.
To compare the results of simulations in this module to the
:mod:`rouse.analytical.rouse` module, you can use code like:
>>> plt.plot(t_save, sim_msd)
>>> real_msd = wlcsim.analytical.rouse.rouse_mid_msd(
...     t_save, b, Nhat, D, num_modes=int(N/2)
... )
>>> plt.plot(t_save, real_msd)
We can also plot simply lines in log-log space that describe the behavior
within each of the three regimes we describe above:
>>> plt.plot(t_save, 6*Dhat*t_save)
>>> plt.plot(t_save, 6*(Dhat/N)*t_save)  # or 6*(D/Nhat)*t_save
>>> # constant prefactor determined empirically...
>>> # no, using the value of 6*(Dhat/N)*t_R doesn't work...
>>> plt.plot(t_save, 1.9544100*b*np.sqrt(D)*np.sqrt(t_save))
where cutting off the number of modes corresponds to ensuring that the rouse
behavior only continues down to the length scale of a single "bead", thus
matching the simulation at arbitrarily short time scales. (Notice that we abide
by the warning above. Our ``Nhat`` is :mod:`wlcsim.analytical.rouse`'s ``N``).

    Recommended "dt" for use with ``rouse*jit`` family of functions.
    Our srk1 scheme is accurate as long as :math:`\Delta t` is less than the
    transition time where the MSD goes from high k behavior (:math:`t^1`) to
    Rouse behavior (:math:`t^{1/2}`).  This is exactly the time required to
    diffuse a Kuhn length, so we just need to ensure that :math:`\Delta t <
    \frac{\hat{b}^2}{6\hat{D}}` in 3D. The "crossover" from fast-k to
    rouse-like behavior takes about one order of magnitude in time, and it was
    determined empirically that decreasing the time step beyond that point
    doesn't seem to make the MSD any more accurate.
    Note that it can be shown that *no* scheme can accurately reproduce the
    bead behavior using larger time s teps than the time required to diffuse a
    distance of one Kuhn length.

    Recall (doi & edwards, eq 4.25) that the first mode's relaxation time is
    :math:`\tau_1 = \frac{\xi N^2}{k \pi^2 }` (see Doi & Edwards, Eq. 4.25),
    and the :math:`p`\th mode is :math:`\tau_p = \tau_1/p^2` (this is the
    exponential falloff rate of the :math:`p`\th mode's correlation function).
    The accuracy of these values was also used when empirically determining the
    recommended ``dt``.

def measured_D_to_rouse(Dapp, d, N, bhat=None, regime='rouse'):
    r"""
    Get the Rouse monomer diffusion coefficient from the "apparent" anomolous
    diffusion coefficient `Dapp` extracted from subdiffusive dynamics of a locus
    on a polymer.

    In general, a discrete Rouse monomer MSD will have three regimes. On time
    scales long enough that the whole polymer diffuses as a large effective
    particle, the MSD is of the form :math:`6 D/\hat{N} t`, where, as is true
    throughout this module, :math:`D` is the diffusivity of a Kuhn length, and
    :math:`\hat{N}` is the number of Kuhn lengths in the polymer.
    This is true down to the full chain's relaxation time (the relaxation time
    of the 0th Rouse mode, also known as the "Rouse time") :math:`t_R = N^2 b^2
    / D`. For times shorter than this, the MSD will scale as :math:`t^{1/2}`.
    Imposing continuity of the MSD, this means that the MSD will behave as
    :math:`\kappa_0 D/\hat{N} (t_R t)^{1/2}`. While one could in principle
    compute :math:`\kappa_0` using :math:`\lim_{t\to 0}` of the analytical
    Rouse MSD result, it was more simple to just determine it empirically. We
    rewrite this MSD as :math:`\kappa b D^{-1/2} t^{1/2}`, and find by
    comparing to the analytical Rouse theory that :math:`\kappa =
    1.9544100(4)`.
    Eventually (at extremely short times), discrete polymers will eventually
    revert to a MSD that scales as :math:`t^1`. This cross-over time/length
    scale defines a "number of segments" :math:`\tilde{N}`, where the
    diffusivity of a segment of length :math:`\tilde{L} = L/(\tilde{N} - 1)`
    matches the time it takes stress to propagate a distance :math:`\tilde{L}`
    along the polymer. Said in other words, for polymer lengths smaller than
    :math:`\tilde{L}`, the diffusivity of the segment outruns the stress
    communication time between two neighboring segments.
    The diffusivity at these extremely short times will look like :math:`6 D
    (\tilde{N} / \hat{N}) t`. In order to simulate this behavior exactly, one
    can simply use a polymer with :math:`\tilde{N}` beads, then all three
    length scales of the MSD behavior will match.
    This three-regime MSD behavior can be very easily visualized in log-log
    space, where it is simply the continuous function defined by the following
    three lines. From shortest to longest time scales, :math:`\log{t}
    + \log{6D(\tilde{N}/\hat{N})}`, :math:`(1/2)\log{t} + \log{\kappa b
    D^{1/2}}`, and :math:`\log{t} + \log{6D\hat{N}}`. The lines
    (in log-log space), have slopes 1, 1/2, and 1, respectively, and their
    "offsets" (y-intercept terms with the log removed) are typically referred
    to as :math:`D_\text{app}`.
    The simulations in this module use the diffusivity of a single Kuhn length
    as input (i.e. plain old :math:`D` is expected as input) but typically,
    measurements of diffusing polymers are done below the Rouse time, and for
    long enough polymers (like a mammalian chromosome), it may be difficult to
    impossible to measure unconfined diffusion at time scales beyond the Rouse
    time. This means you often can't just look at the diffusivity of the whole
    polymer and multiply by :math:`\hat{N}` to get the diffusivity of a Kuhn
    length. And since there's not really a principled way in general to guess
    :math:`\tilde{N}`, you usually can't use the short-time behavior to get
    :math:`D` either, even supposing you manage to measure short enough times
    to see the cross-over back to :math:`t^1` scaling. This means that usually
    the only way one can extract :math:`D` is by measuring
    :math:`D_\text{app}`, since we can use the fact that
    :math:`D_\text{app} = \kappa b D^{1/2}` (the :math:`\kappa` value
    quoted above only works for 3-d motion. I haven't bothered to check if it
    scales linearly with the number of dimensions or like :math:`\sqrt{d}` for
    :math:`d`-dimensional motion, but this shouldn't be too hard if you are
    interested).
    In short, this function gives you :math:`D` given :math:`D_\text{app}`.
